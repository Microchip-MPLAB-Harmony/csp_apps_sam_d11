# TC capture mode

This example shows how to use the TC module in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of an external input.

## Description

The TC channel is configured in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal. The PWM signal is generated using another TC channel which is configured in compare mode. Output of the compare TC channel is connected to input of the capture TC channel.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [SAM D11 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd11-xpro)

- TC1 generates the PWM waveform on pin PA17
  - TC1 output is routed using EIC and EVSYS to TC2 input event line
- TC2 is configured in capture mode
  - Capture trigger is provided by input event line
- Use a jumper wire to connect "Pin 8 of EXT1 (TC1_W01)" to "Pin 5 of EXT1 (EIC_EXTINT4)"
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Console displays the frequency and duty cycle of the input signal
5. Frequency is constant (800 Hz) and duty cycle changes by 1%
